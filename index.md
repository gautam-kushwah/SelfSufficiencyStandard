# Self-Sufficiency Standard - Montgomery County, MD

[Link to the original visualization ](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/countystat/viz/Self-SufficiencyStandard_FD3/Title)

# What is Self-Sufficiency Standard?


Intuitively, self-sufficiency standard to me sounded like a yardstick to measure the ability of someone to be able to live independently without needing help from others.


Formally for this tool, the Self-Sufficiency Standard is defined as follows

<span style="background: #ccc;">
A project of the Center for Women’s Welfare (CWW), the <strong>Self-Sufficiency Standard(SSS)</strong> is a budget-based, living wage measure that defines the real cost of living for working families at a minimally adequate level. The Standard is an affordability measure and an alternative to the official poverty measure.
The Self-Sufficiency Standard determines the amount of income required for working families to meet basic needs at a minimally adequate level, taking into account family composition, ages of children, and geographic differences in costs.

### what is its purpose?

This dynamic tool  strengthens our common understanding of the challenges the working residents of Montgomery County face. The user can apply various filters filters to census data to reflect specific geographic and household information for a given family type. The resulting Self-Sufficiency Standard defined the earning needed to establish economic stability. Additional graphs depict census information about residents living below the self-sufficiency.

The Self-Sufficiency Standard is especially useful in an area like Montgomery County where median income and poverty rates can be misleading. While Montgomery County is considered a very wealthy county, the high cost of living results in many residents struggling to pay
for basic necessities.





### what is the data?
The tool uses data such as

Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics
The minimum wage in Montgomery County
Poverty guidelines based on the number of people in the household
U.S census bureau - American Community survey 5-year estimates ,  which included a wide range of sociodemographics features 

To calculate the the self-sufficiency standard which the CWW thinks is a better measure than poverty guidelines by Office of the Assistant Secretary for planning and Evaluation  (ASPE)


### how was the data collected?
The tool relies on the data collected by the US government.
Census data is collected at regular intervals using methodologies such as total counts, sample surveys, and administrative records. After it is collected or generated, census data is summarized to represent counts or estimates of groups of people for different geographic areas

### who are the users that this visualization was made for?

The Standard is a tool that can be used in a variety of ways-by clients of workforce and training programs seeking paths to self-sufficiency,by program managers to evaluate program effectiveness, and by policymakers and legislators seeking to create programs and pathways that lead to self-sufficiency for working families.



### what questions do people want to ask?

The tool helps us visualize the difference between the federal poverty line and the self-sufficiency standard.

It also helps us understand that the amount a person will make on minimum wage is much lower than the self-sufficiency standard.

It also gives a breakdown of all the household expenditures by category for a particular family.

So the questions that people really want to ask are:

<ul> 
<li>how much does a household need to earn to be able to live comfortably, meeting all their basic needs and requirements based on the type of family and the geographic location?
</li>
<li>
How does this vary across different counties?
</li>
<li>
What components does the SSS have?
</li>
<li>
What is the difference(in USD) between the SSS and median household income?
</li>
<li>
What part of the population lives below the SSS?
</li>
<li>
Which jobs offer the best salaries compared to the SSS?
</li>
</ul>

### how can they find the answers with this tool?

The tools offers various type of visualization to help the user answer these questions.
The user can tweak the inputs to the visualization as per their requirement.
Some visualizations also have a map of the counties which are color coded to aid the user to quickly select that county and see the associated information.
Furthermore, all visualizations also have an “info” button on the top right which the user can utilize to better understand the visualization.
